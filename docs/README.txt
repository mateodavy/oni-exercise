The programming problem that we would like you to attempt is to write some code that identifies the areas of light in in sample TIFF images from a digital microscope.

To give you some context. Super resolution microscopy acquires images as bitmaps. Each bitmap has a number light spots, that look like circular smudges. These are generated by the light emitted from the florescent molecules that are in the sample. The first part of super resolution microscopy is to locate these smudges.

The input to your code is a TIFF image. The image will have some noise. You can assume that each smudge is 6x6 pixels. You should be able to run your code and output a list of rectangles that bound the smudges that you have detected. Your code should be resilient to the noise and any artefacts that appears in the image and find only the circular smudges. The programming problem should take you no more than two or three evenings. Your code should be clean, efficient, and of a quality that you feel would be suitable to be production code. There are 3rd part libraries available that you can use to read tiff images so don’t write your own TFF reader ;-).

We supply a few of test images that we would like your program to work with.
